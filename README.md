# simple_test
Testing simple math with cli

This code makes a testing. 2 difficulties currently availible: 1 - simple operations with *, +, -; 2 - squares of numbers between 11 and 29

Thanks to intcheck function, code is availible to check whether inputed number is not a string(11f, fdgd, etc.) That provides space for making unintended errors.

By using random library, we are able to create pseudo random testing question, simple as it is.

btw t.y. for reading this useless stuff xd/ thanks to jetbrains for their cource! Can't wait to accomplish more of their projects!
